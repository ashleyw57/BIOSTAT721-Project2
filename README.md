# BIOSTAT721 Project 2
**Air Pollution and Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) in Durham County, NC**

---

## Project Overview

Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder characterized by abnormally shaped red blood cells, which can lead to anemia, pain crises, and stroke.  
Recent studies suggest that exposure to air pollutants—such as CO, Ozone (O₃), and PM2.5—may aggravate vaso-occlusion and pain episodes in SCD patients.

This project explores associations between daily air pollution levels and SCD healthcare utilization in Durham County using:
- EPA air quality data (2018–2020) from RDU monitoring station  
- Duke Health SCD emergency visits / hospital data (hypothetical for now)
